# First post: "Conspiracy Iceberg dengan Kearifan Lokal" 
## Tip of The Iceberg

### KKN di Desa Penari  (Student Study Service in Desa Penari)

"KKN di Desa Penari" is a horror story of an Indonesian Student Study Service that takes place in an unknown place that is said to be located in Banyuwangi. 

 Afaik, the village used for the KKNcis haunted by something (most likely a jinn though) that appears as a traditional dance performer. Then two of the friends have pre-marriage sex with each other in an abandoned building, that was used in the past for traditional dance performaces, that is according to local beliefs, it's haunted. That couple then passed away after that study service, for unknown causes that the doctor can't explain.


The author, SimpleM on Twitter, claimed the story is based on an actual story that he claimed to have actually happened back in 2009. However, it is not confirmed yet whether what he claimed is true or not but again, if it's real I'm pretty sure this is just jinn doing stuff. 

When you are going to a remote place, please:

- Don't do pre-marriage sex, of course
- Fricking bring an ustadz who is able to perform a ruqyah, it will really help 

Oh yeah, there are two videos from RÃ ditya Dika, about this story. You can check them out [here](/kkn-penari-videos)

Confidence: 60-70 (perhaps I forgot some things, it's mythical too)
