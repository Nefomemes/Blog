## Waifuism and Pornography



I found this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/waifuism/comments/4wo0wq/opinions_on_fapping_to_your_waifu/) made by someone whose account have been deleted about his opinion on pornography.

> Some people seem to not fap to their waifu at all out of respect. They wouldn't want to degrade her to such a thing. They also don't fap to anything else.

It's one thing I respect from waifuists, they aren't coomers. And that's a good thing because any kind of pornography is way way worse than waifuism. Waifuism is just like, "Umm, I think you dedicated too much to your favourite character. It's not good", but pornography is way way darker.

We doesn't really need to discuss a lot about pornography here.
